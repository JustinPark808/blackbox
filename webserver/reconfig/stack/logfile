Process 1 (astack) registers with the bus during initialization.
Process 3 (a) registers with the bus during initialization.
Process 2 (lstack) registers with the bus during initialization.
Process 1 (astack) asks to read on interface, "inport" marked ready to read.
Process 3 (a) writes to interface "outport", bound to process 1 (astack) interface "inport", sending message.
Process 3 (a) requests a shutdown of the process. Exit code 0, "Init process is silently leaving".
Process 2 (lstack) asks to read on interface, "inport" marked ready to read.
Process 1 (astack) writes to interface "outport", bound to process 2 (lstack) interface "inport", sending message.
Process 1 (astack) asks to read on interface, "inport" marked ready to read.
